Your task is to build a REST service that can handle operations for amending account's balance (both increasing and decreasing).

There are 3 difficulty levels in total where each subsequent level increases in complexity. A level consists of an API specification 
in the Open API 3.0 format and a Postman test suite. 

To complete a level, the corresponding Postman test suite must pass.

## Prerequisites
To run a Postman test suite, use either of the ways:
1. Use [Newman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/command_line_integration_with_newman/). E.g. `newman run candidate/levels/level0/postman-test-suite.json`.
2. Use [Postman Collection Runner](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/intro_to_collection_runs/).

You can use [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) to render the API Spec in the html format. Just copy-paste the API spec to the editor.
